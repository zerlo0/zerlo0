# Hi there, I'm Ramon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22-year-old software developer studying Computer Science. Iâ€™m really into mobile development and love building cool software.

Iâ€™ve got got a degree in Telecommunications Tech and have worked on a bunch of different products like mice, keyboards, and even professional radios. Iâ€™ve been working since I was 16, so Iâ€™ve picked up a lot along the way.

My GitHub might be a bit quiet (college, a full-time job, and adulting leave little time), but you can check out some of the apps Iâ€™ve worked on over the past couple of years on the Google Play Store: Guardian and ISIC:
